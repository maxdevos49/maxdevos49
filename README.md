## Hi there, I'm Max! ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy coding and making stuff!
<!--
#### Check out some of my favorite projects:

### MadOS
An x86 kernel I wrote while exploring lower-level programming. Although it doesn't perform extensive functions, it was an extremely fun and challenging project that I enjoyed building. I even managed to get it to boot on real hardware!

### Boss Fight Battle Ground
This project was the culmination of a semester-long class where myself and three others built a multiplayer Terraria clone using C# and the MonoGame game engine. It was voted the best project of the class!

### Adventures Conquest
A multiplayer game created during the 2018 spring ISU Hackathon with three others. This project earned the 1st place software prize!
